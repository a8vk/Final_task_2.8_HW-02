Game "Sea-battle"

"Sea battle" is a game for two participants, in which players take turns naming coordinates on an opponent's unknown map. If the opponent has a ship at these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is “sinked”, and the one who has fallen gets the right to make one more move. The goal of the player is to be the first to sink all enemy ships.
